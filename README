Idea made 2025-5-4

writing first few functions for pngs
open_png written up to checking that the file header is correct

2024-5-10
Finished with most of the parsing of the png in open_png.
can parse through all the chunks, extract data from header and end chunks and 
identify the rest of the chunks. able to extract data from the IDAT chunk but 
no way to decompress it atm
Next step is to figure out how to decompress -- look at zlib
